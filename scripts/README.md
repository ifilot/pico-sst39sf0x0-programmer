# Scripts

This folder contains a number of Python scripts to test the PICO board. 

* interface-test.py: Test interfacing to the PICO board
* p2k-test.py: Test reading from a P2000T SLOT1 cartridge using the adapter board.
* read-test.py: Test reading from a SST39SF0x0 chip
* write-test.py: Test writing to a SST39SF0x0 chip

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Please note that for many of these tests, the BASICNL v1.1 ROM is used. One
> either needs the original cartridge or a imitation to repeat upon these tests.
> Before execution of these tests, carefully read the test procedure and ensure
> that any used URLs are valid.
