# PICO-SST39SF0x0 Programmer Cases

This folder contains .stl files to create a nice 3d-printable case for your
rom flasher. The files are marked as `bottom` or `top` for the bottom and
top parts of the case. You will need 4xM3 screws to fasten everything together.

The files marked by `mouse_ears` have a 10mm spheres (0.3mm height) attached to
the corners to prevent warping of the object upon printing. These spheres
are called [mouse ears](https://the3dprinterbee.com/mouse-ears-brim-ears/). If
your print is suffering from poor bed adhesion and warping, it is recommended
to use these files.
